# Aim
1. perform exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics on given datasets;
2. construct models for inferential statistical analysis;
3. produce models for predictive statistical analysis;
4. perform fundamental random sampling, simulation and hypothesis testing for required scenarios;
5. implement a model for data analysis through programming and scripting;
6. interpret results for a variety of models.

# What I learned
